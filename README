Crypt::CipherSaber
------------------

version 1.00 Wed Jul 13 01:37:53 UTC 2005

Crypt::CipherSaber is a Perl module providing an object oriented interface to
CipherSaber-1 and CipherSaber-2 encryption.  See the POD for further details on
use.  See http://ciphersaber.gurus.com for more information about CipherSaber.

After unpacking the tarball, to install this module type:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build
    $ ./Build test
    # ./Build install

You can also use the Makefile.PL, but I don't.

The encryption itself is simple, relatively fast, and fairly secure.  It uses a
shared secret system, and is suitable even for binary files.  It should run
without modification anywhere Perl runs.  This ought to work as far back as
Perl 5.004, so please let me know how it does.

Prerequisites:                Scalar::Util
Test requirements:            Test::More, Test::Warn

Potential enhancements and plans:            

 * built-in support for a better randomization scheme?
 * support changing keys in an object rather than creating a new one?
