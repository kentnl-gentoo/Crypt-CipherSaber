Crypt::CipherSaber
------------------

version 0.60
released 7 April 2001

Crypt::CipherSaber is a Perl module providing an object oriented interface to
CipherSaber-1 and CipherSaber-2 encryption.  See the POD for further details on
use.  See http://ciphersaber.gurus.com for more information about CipherSaber.

After unpacking the tarball, to install this module type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The encryption itself is simple, relatively fast, and fairly secure.  It uses a
shared secret system, and is suitable even for binary files.  It should run
without modification anywhere Perl runs.

Prerequisites:				none
Recent changes:				
	- works on Perl 5.004 and later (0.60)
	- supports filehandle-to-filehandle encryption and decryption (0.60)

Enhancements/plans:			

 * built-in support for a better randomization scheme?
 * support changing keys in an object rather than creating a new one?
