=head1 NAME

Crypt::CipherSaber - Perl module implementing CipherSaber encryption.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::CipherSaber;
  my $cs = Crypt::CipherSaber->new('my sad secret key');

  my $coded   = $cs->encrypt('Here is a secret message for you');
  my $decoded = $cs->decrypt($coded);

  # encrypt from and to a file
  open my $in,       'secretletter.txt' or die "Can't open infile: $!";
  open my $out, '>', 'secretletter.cs1' or die "Can't open outfile: $!";
  binmode $in;
  binmode $out;

  $cs->fh_crypt($in, $out, 1);

  # decrypt from and to a file
  open my $in,       'secretletter.txt' or die "Can't open infile: $!";
  open my $out, '>', 'secretletter.cs1' or die "Can't open outfile: $!";

  binmode $in;
  binmode $out;
  $cs->fh_crypt($in, $out);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Crypt::CipherSaber module implements CipherSaber encryption, described at
L<http://ciphersaber.gurus.com/>.  It is simple, fairly speedy, and relatively
secure algorithm based on RC4. I<Relatively>, given RC4.

Encryption and decryption are done based on a secret key, which must be shared
with all intended recipients of a message.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<new($key, $N)>

Initialize a new Crypt::CipherSaber object.  C<$key> is a required parameter:
the key used to encrypt or to decrypt messages.  C<$N> is optional.  If
provided and greater than one, it causes the object to use CipherSaber-2
encryption (slightly slower but more secure).  If not specified, or equal to 1,
the module defaults to CipherSaber-1 encryption.  C<$N> must be a positive
integer greater than one.

=item B<encrypt($message)>

Encrypt a message.  This uses the key stored in the current Crypt::CipherSaber
object.  It generates a 10-byte random IV (Initialization Vector)
automatically, as defined in the RC4 specification.  This returns a string
containing the encrypted message.

Note that the encrypted message may contain unprintable characters, as it uses
the extended ASCII character set (valid numbers 0 through 255).

=item B<decrypt($message)>

Decrypt a message.  For the curious, the first ten bytes of an encrypted
message are the IV, so this must strip it off first.  This returns a string
containing the decrypted message.

The decrypted message may also contain unprintable characters, as the
CipherSaber encryption scheme handles binary filesIf this is important to you,
be sure to treat the results correctly.

=item B<crypt($iv, $message)>

If you wish to generate the IV with a more cryptographically secure random
string (at least compared to Perl's builtin C<rand()> operator), you may do so
separately, passing it to this method directly.  The IV must be a ten-byte
string consisting of characters from the extended ASCII set.

This is generally only useful for encryption, although you may extract the
first ten characters of an encrypted message and pass them in yourself.  You
might as well call B<decrypt()>, though.  The more random the IV, the stronger
the encryption tends to be.  On some operating systems, you can read from
F</dev/random>.  Other approaches are the L<Math::TrulyRandom> module, or
compressing a file, removing the headers, and compressing it again.

=item B<fh_crypt( $in_fh, $out_fh, ($iv))>

For the sake of efficiency, Crypt::CipherSaber can operate on filehandles.
It's not super brilliant, but it's relatively fast and sane.  If your platform
needs to use C<binmode()>, this is your responsibility.  It is also your
responsibility to close the files.

You may also pass in an optional third parameter, an IV.  There are three
possibilities here.  If you pass no IV, C<fh_crypt()> will pull the first ten
bytes from the input filehandle and use that as an IV.  This corresponds to
decryption.  If you pass in an IV of your own, it will use that when encrypting
the file.  If you pass in the value C<1>, it will generate a new, random IV for
you.  This corresponds to an encryption.
